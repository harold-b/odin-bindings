# libClang Bindings

Likely generated from libclang bundled with XCode with:
`Apple clang version 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.3)`

I had copied the headers before and do need recall which were copied.
If not from XCodeBuildTools, then they were likely copied from LLVM @ `3fb0bea859efaf401ad0ce420d7b75e3ff1c4746`
